* index.jsp - it is registration form, and without registration user is not able to move to another page  
* MyServlet.java - processes data from index.jsp  
* main.jsp - it is page, where user is choosing fruits to buy  
* truck.jsp - it is a list of products, that user is buying  
* final.jsp - it is a page with a final price for all products and check  
* Also I used DRY methodology (Don't Repeat Yourself), you can see it in bootstrap.jsp and table.jsp.
